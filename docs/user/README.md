This directory contains much of the end-user documentation for this project.

It is built and stored, checked in, in the `user/generated` folder for easy consumption by end-users.

It is built from a combination of:

* the files under `src` here
* the auto-generated `docs` folder for each resource
* manually added files and examples in `docs-extra` for each resource

**Do not edit the contents of `user/generated` here or in the `docs` for each resource.**
Edit the `src` and `docs-extra` instead, and then rebuild with `npm run build`.
